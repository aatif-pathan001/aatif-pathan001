# Hi there, I'm Aatif Khan Pathan 👋

## 🚀 ML Engineer | Deep Learning & Computer Vision Enthusiast

I'm passionate about building AI systems that solve real-world problems. Currently working as an ML Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services, developing production deep learning solutions for automotive applications.

### 🔭 What I'm working on:
- Production computer vision systems for driver safety using PyTorch, YOLO, and MediaPipe
- LLM-powered RAG systems for document intelligence with LangChain
- Deep learning pipelines for real-time video processing

### 🌱 What I'm learning:
- Advanced MLOps practices (MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes)
- LLM fine-tuning with LoRA/QLoRA
- Real-time video processing optimization
- Advanced RAG architectures

### 💼 Professional Experience:
- **ML Engineer** @ Tata Consultancy Services (2022 - Present)
  - Developed driver monitoring systems achieving 30% improvement in robustness
  - Built RAG pipeline reducing document analysis time by 60%
  - Deployed models serving 1000+ vehicles
